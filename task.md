# Home Task
1. Go to https://newsapi.org/
2. Press ‘Get API Key’ on the right
3. Enter your desired creds and promise to add an attribution link to NewsAPI
4. Press submit and store your API key - this one will be used for API requests
5. Test you did well - https://newsapi.org/v1/articles?source={{CHANEL_CODE}}&apiKey={{YOUR_API_KEY}}
6. Create application, using your GitHub page on your GitHub account: https://pages.github.com/
7. Using ES6 knowledge, create an application that uses NewsAPI, which will run purely on the client-side in latest Chrome browser (no server-side work expected).
8. Your app should provide possibility for a user to select a particular news channel and list any number of latest (let’s say 10) records.
9. Styling is not the requirement for this task, but it will be an additional bonus;
10. You're not allowed to use any framework

## Rate Criteria
* 5 stars (Perfect): Application is usable, designed well, looks good also on mobile, uses as much es6 features as possible (using es6 also in all cases, where are es5 alternatives). 
* 4 stars (Fine): Not all cases use es6 features, designs have issues, limited responsive (looks bad on mobile).
* 3 star (Good Enough): Application has no designs at all, bad UX, only few es6 features used. 
* 2 stars (What home task is about?): Application has no designs, does not use es6 at all. 
* 1 star (Cry Craven): Application is not working.
* 0 star (Loser): No application

## Important Notes
1. Since the idea of the topic is to try ES6 features, your overall rating can be decreased due to usage of significant number of features what have ES2015 equivalent (such as `XMLHttpRequest` because of having `fetch`). However, once you pass the training, ONLY YOU decide what feature and when to use.
2. Using es2016+ features supported by Chrome natively are allowed, if you really want. Just in case.
3. Making the 5 stars home task in one week (before second lecture) automatically places your picture on the 2nd slide of that lecture (even if home task is not verified carefully). Why? Because you deserved it.
